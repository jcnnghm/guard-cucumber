      watch(%r{features/step_definitions/.+}) { 'features' }
    end

== Options

There are several options you can pass to the Cucumber Guard to customize the arguments when calling Cucumber:

    :color => false                        # Disable colored output
    :drb => true                           # Enable Spork DRb server
    :port => 1234                          # Set custom Spork port
    :bundler => false                      # Don't use "bundle exec"
    :rvm => ['1.8.7', '1.9.2']             # Directly run your specs on multiple ruby
    :profile => 'cucumber_profile'         # Let cucumber use another profile than the default one
    :run_all => true		           # Always run all tests, which is useful to work around a cucumber error where step_definitions aren't included when run over drb
